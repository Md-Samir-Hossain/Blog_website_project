## Project Overview

This is a modern blog website created with HTML and CSS. It features a responsive design, article cards with hover effects, 
and a well-organized grid layout to display content. Let's dive into the code structure and design elements:

## Code Structure

The project is organized into two main files: `index.html` and `style.css`.

### `index.html`

- The HTML file defines the structure of the blog website.
- It uses semantic HTML5 elements for the header, main content, and individual article cards.
- Article cards are structured using the grid layout to create a responsive design.
- The author's information, article titles, descriptions, and tags are included within each card.

### `style.css`

- The CSS file contains the styling rules for the entire website.
- It uses CSS Grid to create a responsive grid layout for the article cards.
- Flexbox is employed within the cards to arrange elements, such as the author's information and tags.
- Hover effects are applied to the article images, providing a smooth scale-up transition when hovering over the cards.
- Various CSS properties, including `border-radius`, `object-fit`, and `text-decoration`, are used to enhance the visual presentation of the content.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The use of CSS Grid and media queries ensures the website adapts to different screen sizes,
- providing a seamless viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Hover Effects**: When hovering over an article card, the image scales up slightly, adding an interactive and visually appealing element to the user experience.

- **Tagging System**: Each article is categorized with tags, helping users find content related to their interests easily.

- **Clean and Intuitive Layout**: The layout is designed for easy navigation and readability, with a focus on user-friendly aesthetics.

## CSS Techniques

### CSS Grid

The grid layout is employed in the main content section to create a flexible and responsive structure. 
The `auto-fit` and `minmax` functions enable dynamic column sizing and adaptability to different screen sizes, eliminating the need for media queries.

### Flexbox

Flexbox is used within each article card to arrange elements like the author's information and tags in a clean and organized manner. 
This ensures a consistent and visually appealing display.

### Hover Effects

When hovering over an article card, a smooth image scaling effect is achieved using CSS transitions. This engages users and provides a visually pleasing interaction.
